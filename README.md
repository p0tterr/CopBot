Sneaker/Streetwear bot with use of Selenium and Google Chrome

ATTENTION

This project is for educational purposes only, I do not take resposability of what is done with this code.
This project is in a really early stage so there's still a lot of work to do and it is far away of being 'good'


-Works with(Feb 2021): 
.Footlocker
.Supreme

-What you need:
.Google Chrome installed
.The Link and xpath to the products (Supreme is Tshirts by default

-What's Next?
.As of now I'm trying to make this as user friendly as possible. In a far future I might build an UI and make this a programm. As of now(Feb20210) I'm working on how to bypass captcha, wish me luck xd
